Pet Check In

##  Overview
Noah's Pet Pet Boarding is a company that provides boarding and grooming services for dogs and cats. We want to modernize our operations by introducing custom software that will help replace inefficient paper-based processes.

## Pet Check In
Pet Check-In To update our current processes, we outline our current manual check-in process below, which involves multiple steps and verifications.First, we determine whether the pet is a dog or a cat. Next, we determine if boarding space is available for the pet. There are currently 30 spaces for dogs and 12 spaces for cats. We would like the ability to update these settings as needed. If boarding space is available, we identify whether the pet is a new or returning visitor. If the pet has stayed with us before, we are seeking the ability to update information as needed. If the pet is a new visitor, we would like the opportunity to collect all the appropriate information.
Additionally, we would like the ability to gather information on the length of stay for each pet and if grooming services are required. Grooming services are only offered for dogs that stay at Pet BAG for two or more days. No grooming services are offered for cats
